The Crypto Currency System Based on CPoC.

About DePINC
---------------

- DePINC is a new type of crypto currency based on Proof of Capacity and Proof of Space and Time(Chia).
- DePINC uses an upgraded version of cPOC mining (Conditioned Proof of Capacity), with a perfect economic model and consensus algorithm.
- DePINC uses Chia's PoST consensus protocol after upgrade
- DePINC uses hard disk as the participant of consensus, which reduces power consumption.
- DePINC mining lowers the entry barriers, and makes the coin generation process more decentralized, secure and reliable.
- Compared with POW mining, cPOC and PoST mining saves energy, consumes much less power, has lower noise, no heat, and is anti-ASIC. cPOC-mining-based DePINC can realize the original intention of Satoshi Nakamoto ---- everyone can become a miner.
- Lowered the cost of credit, increased the strength and breadth of consensus, and improved the security of the consensus architecture

information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bhdone/btchd/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of DePINC Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

The DePINC Core base on Bitcoin Core and shares resources with it.

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.

Translators should also subscribe to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-translators).
