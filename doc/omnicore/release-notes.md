Omni Core v0.8.2
================

v0.8.2 is a minor release and adds new RPCs to interact with the distributed exchange, which can be used to trade any tokens for bitcoins. It also incorporates significant performance improvements for the initial synchronization and upgrading from older versions of Omni Core.

Upgrading from 0.8.1 does not require a rescan and can be done very fast without interruption.

Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to upgrade
--------------

If you are running Bitcoin Core or an older version of Omni Core, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down, then copy the new version of `omnicored`, `omnicore-cli` and `omnicore-qt`. On Microsoft Windows the setup routine can be used to automate these steps.

When upgrading from an older version than 0.8.0, the database of Omni Core is reconstructed, which can easily consume several hours. During the first startup historical Omni Layer transactions are reprocessed and Omni Core will not be usable for several hours up to more than a day. The progress of the initial scan is reported on the console, the GUI and written to the `debug.log`. The scan may be interrupted and can be resumed.

Upgrading from 0.8.1 does not require a rescan and can be done very fast without interruption.

Downgrading
-----------

Downgrading to an Omni Core version prior to 0.8.0 is not supported.

Compatibility with Bitcoin Core
-------------------------------

Omni Core is based on Bitcoin Core 0.18.1 and can be used as replacement for Bitcoin Core. Switching between Omni Core and Bitcoin Core may be supported.

However, it is not advised to upgrade or downgrade to versions other than Bitcoin Core 0.18. When switching to Omni Core, it may be necessary to reprocess Omni Layer transactions.


Improvements

Other RPC improvements
----------------------

- Active orders on the distributed exchange are now properly listed with the `omni_getactivedexsells` RPC.
- Parsing of the `ecosystem` parameter of the `omni_sendissuancecrowdsale`, `omni_sendissuancefixed`, `omni_sendissuancemanaged`, `omni_createpayload_issuancefixed`, `omni_createpayload_issuancecrowdsale`, `omni_createpayload_issuancemanaged` RPCs was fixed.
- Parsing of the `redeemkey` parameter of the `omni_createrawtx_multisig` RPC was fixed.
- When the node is not synchronized, `omni_decodetransaction` needs to be provided with all inputs. If they are missing, a proper error message is now shown.
- The fields `issuer`, `creationtxid`, `fixedissuance` and `managedissuance` are now included, when using `omni_listproperties`.
- Spelling and language improvements.


Reporting vulnerabilities
-------------------------

A security policy was created. To see instructions on how to report a vulnerability for Omni Core the Omni Layer protocol, please see [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/master/SECURITY.MD).
